# Welcome!
I am a PhD student in Economics at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and an ESSGN doctoral candidate at the [European Social Science Genetics Network](https://essgn.org/). My research interests broadly lie in empirical microeconomics; in my PhD I am researching how environmnetal and genetic forces jointly shape health and well-being over the life course.

## Current projects

This paper leverages granular survey data from within the conflict theater of Afghanistan to investigate how plausibly exogenous exposure to Islamic State (IS) propaganda influences views towards local and international forces. We study two mediums of terrorist propaganda, exploiting high-frequency time variation in global distribution of IS videos and plausibly exogenous signal penetration of a prominent IS radio tower in Afghanistan. Our findings suggest violent video and radio content undermines public support for IS and its key opponents, while increasing demand for international forces to remain in country. By contrast, videos depicting a capacity for IS governance boost their support.
